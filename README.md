# 🗄️ DDL Day-1 Challenge

Welcome to my **SQL Daily Coding Challenges** series!  
This repository documents my first challenge focused on **Data Definition Language (DDL)** concepts in SQL.  
The goal is to practice **table creation, constraints, and schema design** while building a strong foundation for data analytics.

## 📌 Challenge Overview
- **Topic:** SQL DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements)  
- **Objective:** Create tables with proper constraints to ensure data integrity  
- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Primary keys  
  - Foreign keys  
  - NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints  
  - Schema organization

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `scripts/` → SQL scripts for table creation and constraints  
- `examples/` → Sample queries and outputs  
- `notes/` → Daily learning notes and explanations  
- `README.md` → Project overview (this file)

---

## 🚀 Purpose
This repo is part of my **daily SQL coding practice** to:  
- Strengthen fundamentals in database design  
- Build a portfolio of validated SQL scripts  
- Share progress with recruiters and peers
